# RegexHub
An Angular based client side rich SPA to consolidate  all regular expressions which I'm going to come across the SO questions.

## Why am I doing this?
Looking forward to try out some of the cooolest features I've learned in Angular.js and build something useful for the community.
At the meantime, I'm learning about Regular Exprssions and I thought it would be better to consolidate everything everything in a 
webpage for my reference later.

## How to build it?
